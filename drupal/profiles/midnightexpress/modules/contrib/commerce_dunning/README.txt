Commerce Dunning Management
================================================================================

Project homepage: http://drupal.org/project/commerce_dunning

This module supports implementing a dunning management process within Drupal
Commerce. Dunning management (Delinquent User Notification) is the automated
process that's kicked off when a charge attempt of a recurring order fails. It
involves periodic customer communication and payment retries.

The module strongly relies on Commerce Card on File which is capable of storing
and reusing credit card data on subsequent orders. Functionality is implemented
by utilizing Rules. Commerce Dunning provides the basic toolset for building a
dunning management process, whereas Commerce Dunning Defaults provides an actual
out of the box configuration that is easy to customize.
