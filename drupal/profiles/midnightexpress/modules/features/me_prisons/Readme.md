Midnight Express
================

Named in honor of the Midnight Special legal collective, Midnight Express is a platform for campaigns to support prisoners.

Currently, it is mostly just a directory of FOP prisons that will be used to cross-reference with prisoners and campaigns.

BOP API
-------

For purposes of using the feeds importer, use this undocumented bop.gov API I discovered:

http://www.bop.gov/PublicInfo/execute/locations?todo=query&output=json

There are promising endpoints buried within the scripts for the Inmate Locator as well... hmm!!
